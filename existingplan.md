## 3. Relationships

- **User 1:N Clients**: A user (tax professional) can manage multiple clients.
- **Client 1:N Tax Documents**: Each client can have multiple documents.
- **Client 1:N Tax Returns**: Each client can have multiple tax returns (one per year).
- **Client 1:N Payments**: Each client can make multiple payments.
- **User 1:N Audit Logs**: Each user action is logged.

## 4. Additional Tables (Optional/Advanced)

- **Notifications**: For system alerts and reminders.
- **Settings**: For user or system preferences.
- **Support Tickets**: For client support requests.

---

## 5. Key Considerations

- **Security**: Passwords hashed, sensitive data encrypted, audit logging.
- **Compliance**: Data retention policies, GDPR/IRS requirements.
- **Scalability**: Indexing, partitioning for large data sets.
- **Backups**: Regular automated backups and disaster recovery.

## 7. Next Steps

1. Finalize entity fields and relationships.
2. Choose database technology (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
3. Create migration scripts for schema setup.
4. Implement data access layer in application.
