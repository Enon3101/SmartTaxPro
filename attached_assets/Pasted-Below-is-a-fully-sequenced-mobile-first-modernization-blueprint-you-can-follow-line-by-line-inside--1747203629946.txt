Below is a fully sequenced, mobile-first modernization blueprint you can follow line-by-line inside Replit. It starts with an audit, walks through code changes (with explanations), layers in PWA features, and finishes with automated testing, autoscaling deployment, and analytics. If you tick every box, you’ll end up with a Reddit-style app that loads in < 2.5 s on 3G, passes Lighthouse’s mobile audits, “installs” like a native app, and feels perfectly thumb-friendly.

1  Baseline & Branch
Task	Commands / Files	Why
Run a mobile Lighthouse audit	In Replit Shell:
npx lhci collect --url=https://<your-repl>.repl.co --settings.preset=mobile --output=./lighthouse-baseline	Gives you an objective JSON baseline to beat. Google flags ≥ 2.5 s LCP and > 200 ms TBT as problem areas. 
Chrome for Developers
Create a working branch	git checkout -b mobile-redesign	Keeps risk isolated while you refactor.

2  Install Mobile-First Tooling
Add Tailwind

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
Tailwind’s mobile-first utility classes let you iterate without writing custom media queries. 
Tailwind CSS

Add Playwright & Lighthouse-CI for mobile checks

bash
Copy
Edit
npm i -D @playwright/test @lhci/cli
npx playwright install
Playwright can emulate real devices, while Lighthouse-CI fails builds that fall below performance budgets.

3  Refactor the Layout (Mobile-First)
3.1 Viewport & Fluid Grid
Add in index.html <head>:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
The tag tells browsers not to zoom-out desktop layouts on phones. 
W3Schools

Switch your CSS to min-width breakpoints (mobile-first) or rewrite templates with Tailwind classes like:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto grid gap-4">
3.2 Bottom Navigation
Create components/BottomNav.jsx:

jsx
Copy
Edit
export default function BottomNav() {
  return (
    <nav className="fixed bottom-0 inset-x-0 bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 shadow-xl flex justify-around py-2">
       {/* icons truncated for brevity */}
    </nav>
  );
}
Bottom navs keep your five primary actions within thumb reach on 6-inch screens.

3.3 Tap-Target Sizing
Ensure every button has at least class="min-w-11 min-h-11" (≈44 × 44 px). That’s Apple’s minimum for fingertips.

4  Progressive Web App (PWA) Layer
4.1 manifest.json
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "My Reddit Clone",
  "short_name": "R-Lite",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#6200ee",
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/icons/192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" },
    { "src": "/icons/512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png" }
  ]
}
Icons at 192 px and 512 px satisfy install prompts across Android, iOS, and desktop PWAs.

4.2 Service Worker (Stale-While-Revalidate)
js
Copy
Edit
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.open('runtime').then(async cache => {
      const cached = await cache.match(event.request);
      const network = fetch(event.request).then(resp => {
        cache.put(event.request, resp.clone());
        return resp;
      });
      return cached || network;
    })
  );
});
The pattern shows users cached pages instantly while silently refreshing in the background.

5  Performance & Media
Action	Code / Tool	Rationale
Lazy-load below-fold images	<img loading="lazy" …>	Native lazy loading in Chrome & Firefox defers bytes until scroll. 
MDN Web Docs
Convert assets to WebP / AVIF	npx @squoosh/cli *.png --avif	AVIF often saves ~20–30 % over WebP, 50 % over JPEG. 
shortpixel.com
Adopt Material 3 tokens	import @material/material-color-utilities and map to Tailwind CSS vars	You get automatic light/dark schemes and dynamic hues for a 2025 aesthetic. 
Material Design

6  Accessibility Sweep
Use semantic tags (<header>, <main>, <nav>, <button>).

Ensure color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (Tailwind’s prose-invert helps in dark mode).

Add ARIA live regions to update vote scores without page refresh.

These steps widen your audience and are now a ranking signal for Google.

7  Automated Mobile Testing
7.1 Playwright Device Emulation
playwright.config.ts

ts
Copy
Edit
import { devices } from '@playwright/test';
export default {
  projects: [
    { name: 'Mobile Chrome', use: devices['Pixel 7'] }
  ]
};
Playwright simulates touch, viewport, and DPR in CI.

7.2 Lighthouse-CI Budget Gate
.github/workflows/perf.yml

yaml
Copy
Edit
- uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v10
  with:
    urls: 'https://<preview-url>'
    budgetPath: './budget.json'
If a commit makes LCP worse than 2.5 s, the build fails. 
GitHub

8  Deploy & Autoscale on Replit
bash
Copy
Edit
replit deployments create autoscale \
  --run "npm start" \
  --plan standard
Autoscale adds instances when traffic spikes and drops them to zero when idle, saving cost. 
Replit Docs

Attach your custom domain from the Replit UI; HTTPS is automatic and is required for PWA installability.

9  Lightweight Analytics & Core Web Vitals
Insert Plausible’s 1 kB script in index.html:

html
Copy
Edit
<script defer data-domain="r-lite.app" src="https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js"></script>
Collect device, orientation, and the “Vitals” trio (LCP, FID, CLS) without the 45 kB Google Analytics payload. 
Plausible Analytics

10  Beta Toggle & Feedback Loop
Deploy the new UI behind a query-param flag (?v=next) or feature toggle. Announce the beta in-app, solicit feedback, and watch metrics for one week. Mobile users notoriously dislike surprise redesigns; Reddit itself learned this during its 2018 overhaul.
