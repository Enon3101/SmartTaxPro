Error Log: Persistent issues modifying client/src/pages/ItrFiling.tsx

Date: 2025-05-25

Issue Summary:
Multiple attempts to modify client/src/pages/ItrFiling.tsx using the `replace_in_file` tool (and previously `write_to_file`) have resulted in the tool reporting an "Unexpected token" error (e.g., "Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'>'}` or `>`?") at the end of the file.

Observations:
1.  This error seems to indicate that the tool's own response metadata (like XML tags) might be getting appended to or mixed with the actual file content during the write/replace operation, thus corrupting the file from the perspective of linters/parsers.
2.  Despite this reported error, the `file_content` provided by the tool in the error messages *before* the "Unexpected token" line often appears to correctly reflect the intended code changes.
3.  The file `client/src/pages/ItrFiling.tsx` is believed to be in a state that includes:
    *   Expanded interfaces for `DeductionsChapterVIA` and `initialFormData`.
    *   Updated `useEffect` logic to correctly load all form sections (personalInfo, incomeDetails including capitalGains, and deductions including chapterVIA).
    *   New UI input fields for all expanded deduction items within the "Deductions (Chapter VI-A)" section.
    *   An updated `handleSaveDraft` function that correctly separates `section80C` and `section80D` for specific API endpoints and sends the rest of the `chapterVIA` deductions to the `/other-deductions` endpoint.
    *   The file `client/src/lib/itrJsonGenerator.ts` has been created and linted successfully.

Last Attempted Operation (before this log):
Adding a "Download ITR JSON" button and its handler function (`handleDownloadJson`) to `client/src/pages/ItrFiling.tsx`, which would import and use functions from `client/src/lib/itrJsonGenerator.ts`.

Next Steps (as per user request):
Proceed with Phase 4 of plan.txt, starting with the integration of the JSON download functionality into `client/src/pages/ItrFiling.tsx`. Extreme care will be taken with `replace_in_file` operations, using the latest known ostensibly correct file content as the baseline.
